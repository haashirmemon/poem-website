    copypaste poetry<br>
    when was the last time<br>
a mannequin had an expressive face<br>
behind the mask?<br>

behind the blank<br>
glossy-eyed barrier<br>
of a window glass?<br>
<br><br>
when was the last time<br>
you saw a black man<br>
stand strong and unashamed<br>
with his dark, holy features,<br>
center-framed in a bleached-out world,<br>
<br><br>
fully aware of being<br>
the blurred-out version<br>
of his true self?<br>

III.
I am a free token<br>
for closed minds<br>
who are broke with blind eyes, a splash,<br>
a cool glass<br>
for the sun’s predictable clash<br>
with Charleston streets.<br>

I am the man<br>
without a mirror,<br>
unable to look at himself<br>
in a place<br>
surrounded by the water’s reflection.<br>

someone who is always seen as the “other”<br>
in a copy and paste culture,<br>
void of color.<br>

IV.
I’m looking for memory coordinates<br>
instead of road maps through familiar places,<br>

I’m looking to unravel headphone cords<br>
in a wireless world.<br>
