            Pretty women wonder where my secret lies.<br>
I'm not cute or built to suit a fashion model's size<br>
But when I start to tell them,<br>
They think I'm telling lies.<br>
I say,<br>
It's in the reach of my arms<br>
The span of my hips,<br>
The stride of my step,<br>
The curl of my lips.<br>
I'm a woman<br>
Phenomenally.<br>
Phenomenal woman,<br>
That's me.<br>

I walk into a room<br>
Just as cool as you please,<br>
And to a man,<br>
The fellows stand or<br>
Fall down on their knees.<br>
Then they swarm around me,<br>
A hive of honey bees.<br>
I say,<br>
It's the fire in my eyes,<br>
And the flash of my teeth,<br>
The swing in my waist,<br>
And the joy in my feet.<br>
I'm a woman<br>
Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,<br>
That's me.<br>
<br><br><br>
Men themselves have wondered<br>
What they see in me.<br>
They try so much<br>
But they can't touch<br>
My inner mystery.<br>
When I try to show them<br>
They say they still can't see.<br>
I say,<br>
It's in the arch of my back,<br>
The sun of my smile,<br>
The ride of my breasts,<br>
The grace of my style.<br>
