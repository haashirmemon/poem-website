            It's in the arch of my back,<br>
            It
            The sun of my smile,<br>
The ride of my breasts,<br>
The grace of my style.<br>
I'm a woman<br>

Phenomenally.
Phenomenal woman,<br>
That's me.
<br><br>
Now you understand<br>
Just why my head's not bowed.<br>
I don't shout or jump about<br>
Or have to talk real loud.<br>
When you see me passing<br>
It ought to make you proud.<br>
I say,<br>
It's in the click of my heels,<br>
The bend of my hair,<br>
the palm of my hand,<br>
The need of my care,<br>
'Cause I'm a woman<br>
Phenomenally.<br>
Phenomenal woman,<br>
That's me.<br>
